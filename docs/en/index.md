This documentation describes the usage of scm-scw-plugin. It is available in different languages and versions, which can be selected in the menu on the right.

The Secure Code Warrior plugin finds security related keywords (e.g. XSS) in pull requests and automatically adds learning resources (videos and links). 
With these resources, developers can learn how to fix the security issue right away and by themselves. 
The installation only requires a few manual steps, which are described in installation. The usage shows you the use cases for the plugin.
